  <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
	  <p>I used the program Adobe Express and was able to create a collage that reflects my aesthetic. I started by gathering images that I felt connected to and felt express myself. I used pictures to show an extraterrestrial feeling because I sometimes feel disconnected with reality. I included pictures to show how I feel about the feeling, I contradict the bright colors with black and white pictures. I think my collage matches my aesthetic because not only the way I dress but my first impression when I first meet people. It shows my head space and how I feel on a day to day basis.</p>

  <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
	  <p>I started by outlining my character design, I used the pencil tool to fill each pixel for the outline of my character and what I wanted for my background. For my character design I went for a fairy in the woods. My characters are wearing a spring green leaf long sleeve and a fall brown leaf pants. She has long brown hair and wears a mushroom for a hat. My character would be in an adventure game and she will help other fairies with tasks. My character will be able to collect items after every task and be able to decorate their tree hut.</p>

	 <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
	  <p>I used the image that I changed from pexel, I basically flipped the image  and duplicated it. When I did each step the picture changed and merged. Slowly the fall picture turned into a kaleidoscope and the image looked like glass. I loved that the color orange was very prominent and had a nice representation of fall in a cool way. </p>
